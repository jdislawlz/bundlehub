            <h2>The Bundle Hub, Inc. Privacy Policy </h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important, so The Bundle Hub, Inc. ("The Bundle Hub," "we," "us," or "our") has created the following Privacy Policy to let users of thebundlehub.com or The Bundle Hub’s mobile application (individually and collectively, the "Service"), know what information we collect when you visit the Service, why we collect it, and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of the Service; it does not apply to other online or offline The Bundle Hub sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the customer/purchaser utilizing our Service. This Privacy Policy is governed by our Terms of Service. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy, then The Bundle Hub will post a notice on thebundlehub.com. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.

            <h2>What Information Is Collected? </h2>
            <p>"Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. The Bundle Hub collects the following Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use our Service: your email address, and payment information (credit card and address, PayPal). If you correspond with us by email or through the Service, we may retain the content of your messages, your email address and our responses. 
The Bundle Hub also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. Our Service uses Google Analytics to help us learn about who visits our site and what pages are being viewed. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features. 
When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets The Bundle Hub help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

            <h2>How Is Such Information Used? </h2>
            <p>We use your Personal Information to provide you the services offered on our Service. The Bundle Hub may also use your Personal Information in order to contact you if you request customer or technical support. 
The Bundle Hub uses browser data like which operating system you are using to improve the Service’s user experience by making your download page default to the game builds corresponding to your current operating system. 
We use cookies to improve our Service and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Cookies from our Service cannot be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them. 
We may use certain information about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. 
We may make your Personal Information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your Personal Information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your Personal Information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site (the "Analytical Data"). We may make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties. </p>

            <h2>Is The Information Shared or Disclosed? </h2>
            <p>The Bundle Hub does not sell or share the information it collects through the Service except as described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected from you is disclosed and used to complete and support your purchases from and use of The Bundle Hub Service and to comply with any requirements of law. For example, we may disclose information to third party payment processors. We may also disclose information to third party social networks at your direction, e.g. when you "tweet" or "like" something on the Service. 
From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events. 
The Bundle Hub may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on The Bundle Hub or the Service; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of The Bundle Hub; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of The Bundle Hub, its web sites or the public. If The Bundle Hub or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that The Bundle Hub goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of The Bundle Hub may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. </p>

Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems. <p>

You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for thirty (30) days after one party has provided written notice of the Claim to the other party, all parties shall join in mediation services in Orlando, Florida with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
