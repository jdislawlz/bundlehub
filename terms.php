We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason.

Your Information. The Service is only for sales of products or product rights (collectively, "Products") to end user customers for their personal, non-commercial use. The personal information you submit to the Service is subject to The Bundle Hub's Privacy Policy, which is expressly made part of these Terms. If you have not already read The Bundle Hub's Privacy Policy, you should do so now. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information required to register with the Service and at other points as may be required in the course of using the Service ("Registration Data"). You shall not impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or entity. You further agree to maintain and update your Registration Data as required to keep it accurate, current, and complete. The Bundle Hub may terminate your access to any or all of the Service if any information you provide is false, inaccurate or incomplete. You agree that The Bundle Hub may, whether itself or through third party providers, store and use the Registration Data you provide (such as credit card information) in connection with the Services. 
Once you make a purchase, you should receive a unique download page. You shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose the unique URL for your download page to anyone else or use anyone else's download page. You are solely and entirely responsible for all activities that occur on your download page. The Bundle Hub shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your download page. 
Objectionable Material. You understand that by using the Service and Products, you may encounter content that may be deemed mature, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language or adult themes, and which may be due to the content of the Product or your interactions with other users in the course of using the Products. You agree to use the Service at your sole risk and that The Bundle Hub shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be mature, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. 
Product Requirements. Use of the Service and/or Products requires a compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining patches, updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service and/or Products involves hardware, software, and Internet access (high speed Internet access is strongly recommended), your ability to use the Service and/or Products may be affected by these factors. You are responsible for being aware of any particular system requirements of any Product and for your ability to meet such requirements, which may change from time to time. Applicable system requirements at the time of purchase can be found on the information page for each Product. Certain Products also may require you to register an account with a third party (which may require an initial and/or ongoing fee) or to install third party software and content in connection with their use. The Bundle Hub does not assume any responsibility or liability for any such fee, account or third party software or content. Physical copies Products are not available. If you are having difficulty downloading the Product or encounter any other issues with the purchase, download or activation of a Product, you should contact us at support@thebundlehub.com

            <h2>How Is Such Information Used? </h2>
            <p>We use your Personal Information to provide you the services offered on our Service. The Bundle Hub may also use your Personal Information in order to contact you if you request customer or technical support. 
The Bundle Hub uses browser data like which operating system you are using to improve the Service’s user experience by making your download page default to the game builds corresponding to your current operating system. 
We use cookies to improve our Service and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Cookies from our Service cannot be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them. 
We may use certain information about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. 
We may make your Personal Information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your Personal Information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your Personal Information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site (the "Analytical Data"). We may make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties. </p>

            <h2>PAYMENT AND DELIVERY  </h2>
            <p>Your total price will include the price of the Product plus any applicable sales or use taxes in effect on the time of purchase, and based on country data you provide on your download page. The Bundle Hub reserves the right to change prices and availability of Products at any time. If you are not located in either the US or the EU your purchase price will be the full amount of the price posted and failure on The Bundle Hub's part to invoice you for any applicable sales and use taxes, value added taxes and other taxes does not relieve you of the liability to pay such taxes, and you must pay to the applicable taxing authority any such taxes which may be due as a result of your purchase through the Service. 
Orders. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. The Bundle Hub reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may require additional verification or information before accepting any order. 
Payment for Products. The Service uses PayPal, and other payment providers as may be indicated on the purchase page. You agree to pay for all Products you purchase through the Service, and that The Bundle Hub may charge your chosen payment method for any Products purchased, and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) as may be accrued by or in connection with your account. All fees will be billed to the payment method you designate during the checkout process. Billing to your selected payment method occurs at the time of purchase. If you use the services of an alternate payment method provider such as PayPal, you will be bound by that party's terms and conditions, which are available on that party's website. You also may be required to create an account with such payment method provider and to provide that payment method provider with your credit card or other details. The Bundle Hub reserves the right to change the payment methods offered at any time. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TO PAY FOR SUCH PURCHASES. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THIS SITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility. These Terms do not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you or The Bundle Hub. You may also have additional rights under applicable law. 
Delivery of Products. On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt or prevent the download or activation of your Product. The Bundle Hub shall have no liability for issues encountered with downloading, activating or using Products due to factors beyond its control, including your computer's performance and the speed of your internet connection. You understand that in some instances Product release dates may be delayed and that release dates and times posted on the Service are only estimates, and you will not be entitled to any refund for a delayed product release date. Our obligation to deliver any Product to you shall be complete at the time when and place where you first receive the information necessary to commence download of such Product. In all circumstances it is your responsibility to ensure that the Product is correctly and completely installed on your computer. 
No Ongoing Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, The Bundle Hub and its licensors reserve the right, without liability to you, to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Products, content, or other materials comprising a part of or sold through the Service at any time without notice. You acknowledge that some aspects of the Service, Products, and administering of our usage rules entails the ongoing involvement of The Bundle Hub. Accordingly, in the event that The Bundle Hub changes any part of the Service or discontinues the Service, which The Bundle Hub may do at its election, you acknowledge that you may no longer be able to use Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that The Bundle Hub shall have no liability to you in such case. You understand that nothing in these Terms entitles you to any future updates, versions or enhancements to any Product (although The Bundle Hub may offer such updates, versions or enhancements at its sole discretion). The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service. </p>
